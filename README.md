Tag Corral
=========

Tag Corral is a Java-based file browser which allows viewing embedded tags inside binary. It was created back in 2011 as an offshoot of my previous [Klang](https://github.com/malictus/klang) program. I never got that far with it, but the interface works pretty well and contains some interesting tidbits. The jar file is self-contained and clickable for launching the application.
